# PyBer Ride sharing Analysis.
## 1. Overview
#### The CEO of PyBEr is looking for summary of the ride sharing apps business based on the city type which are urban, suburban and rural city types.This work involves the use of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlb to create a summary DataFrame and a multi-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban.
## 2. Results
### 2.1 Summary Dataframe
#### The PyBer ride sharing data for different city types which depicts the drivers count, total fares and fare analysis is shown in the summary below:

#### Based on the city type, Urban city type had more drivers than total number of rides, which created an  impact on the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The Urban drivers had the lowest average fare per ride and earned significantly less than the Rural drivers. This also indicates the the competiion between drivers to serve limited number of passenfers in urban cities.The Rural city type had the least number of total drivers with the highest average fare per driver even though the ratio of total rides to total drivers is equivalent to the Suburban city type. This demonstrates there is less rides and less drivers in rural setting which creates less competition among drivers and drivers can keep fare fairly high.
