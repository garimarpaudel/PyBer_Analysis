# PyBer Ride sharing Analysis.
## 1. Overview
#### The CEO of PyBEr is looking for summary of the ride sharing apps business based on the city type which are urban, suburban and rural city types.This work involves the use of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlb to create a summary DataFrame and a multi-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type: Rural, Suburban, and Urban.
## 2. Results
### 2.1 Summary Dataframe
#### The PyBer ride sharing data for different city types which depicts the drivers count, total fares and fare analysis is shown in the summary below:

#### Based on the city type, Urban city type had more drivers than total number of rides, which created an  impact on the average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The Urban drivers had the lowest average fare per ride and earned significantly less than the Rural drivers. This also indicates the the competiion between drivers to serve limited number of passenfers in urban cities.The Rural city type had the least number of total drivers with the highest average fare per driver even though the ratio of total rides to total drivers is equivalent to the Suburban city type. This demonstrates there is less rides and less drivers in rural setting which creates less competition among drivers and drivers can keep fare fairly high. 

### 2.2 Total fare by City Type 
#### The following plot depicts the the average Fare of PyBer ride sharing for theree different city types in first quarter of 2019.

#### After the end of winter the PyBer ride sharing fare starts increasing and peaks at spring season for all three city types in March. For urban city type, the fare holds in similar manner as spring till end of April 2019. After spring and start of summer the Pyber fare starts to delcine for sub-urban and rural city types. 

## 3. Summary

### (i) From the summary Dataframe, we can see there are more drivers than total rides in urban setting. The higher drivers number and lower rides indicates there is high competition in urban setting and PyBer can promote urban drivers to cover longer distance and compensate by setting the rate per base mileage and then with extra $0.6-$0.8 per miles based on the distance. 

### (ii) The comparision of rides and driver indicates that, PyBer's lack of marketing in the rural areas compared to urban. For PyBer to expand its business, more maketing for drivers and customers can be done in suburban areas and extend it to rural areas. 

### (III) Data used for sentiment analysis such as customers ratings, drivers ratings, and reviews of customers and drivers can provide better insights for the marketing and business expansion for PyBer.
